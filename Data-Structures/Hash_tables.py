# HASH TABLES

# A Hash Table is a data structure that stores values which
# have keys associated with each of them. Furthermore, it
# supports lookup efficiently if we know the key associated
# with the value. Hence it is very efficient in inserting
# and searching, irrespective of the size of the data.
