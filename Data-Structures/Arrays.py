ARRAYS

                      1.1 Theory

An array is a structure of fixed-size, which can hold items of the
same data type. It can be an array of integers, an array of floating
point numbers, an array of strings or even an array of arrays
(such as 2-dimensional arrays). Arrays are indexed meaning that
random access is possible.

                      1.3 Array Operations

- TRAVERSE: Go through the elements and print them
- SEARCH: Search for an element in the array. You can
      search the element by its value and index
- UPDATE: Update the value of an existing element at a given index

- INSERTING elements to an array and DELETING elements from
      an array cannot be done straight away as arrays are
      fixed in size. If you want to insert an element to an
      array, first you have to create a new array with increased
      size (current size + 1), copy the existing elements and add
      the nwe element. The same goes for the deletion with a new
      array of reduced size.


                      1.4 Applications Of Arrays
  - Used as the building blocks to build other data structures
      such as array lists, heaps, hash tables, vectors and matrices.
  - Used for different sorting algorithms such as insertion sort,
      quick sort, bubble sort and merge sort.
